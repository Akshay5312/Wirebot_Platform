# Wirebot_Platform
developed for GoatHacks

The wirebot is an inexpensive and scaleable option for robot operation in indoor spaces. It can move around a large area and carry objects such as manipulators, grippers, sensors, etcetera. This project develops a platform to be built upon for wirebot development

The same 50 dollar robot can be used in a 10 foot space, or a 1000 foot space. The applications are left to be found by developers, but some definite areas of interest are 

surveying -- Adding sensors to percieve a warehouse or indoor environment 

hospital care -- move things in hospital rooms, where patients may be bed-ridden

manipulation -- moving manipulators around an area


here are some trajectories drawn with the wirebot
